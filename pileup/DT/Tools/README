Step 1: Go to CMS DAS and find the JetHT and ZeroBias MINIAOD corresponding to the run era.
Step 2: List these accroding to the template in the init.sh file.
Step 3: (optional) Triggerlister can be run to check the active triggers.
Step 4: Set the correct certificate and run init.sh
Step 5: Set the correct normtag and run brilcalc.sh
Step 6: Set all correct settings and run puhistos.sh:
 - One needs to adjust the pileup file, normtag and datacert here
 - One needs to check that the min bias xsec has not changed (default) for brilcalc
Step 7: Copy everything from lxplus to a jetphys installation; run "root -l -b -q ../combine.C". This will create a collection of pileup_DTu.root.
 - The unnormalized histograms may be safely added with hadd.
 - This requires the correct weight values to be present in settings.h.
Step 8: Run "root -l -b -q ../normalize.C". This will result in appropriately weighted histos.
