Step 1: Go to CMS DAS and find the JetHT and ZeroBias MINIAOD corresponding to the run era.
Step 2: List these accroding to the template in the init.sh file.
Step 3: (optional) Triggerlister can be run to check the active triggers.
Step 4: Set the correct certificate and run init.sh (this produces luminosity jsons)
Step 5: Set the correct normtag and run brilcalc.sh (this produces the luminosity information, to be added in settins.h)
Step 6: Set all correct settings and run puhistos.sh:
 - One needs to adjust the pileup file and normtag here
 - One needs to check that the min bias xsec has not changed (default) for brilcalc
Step 7: Copy everything from lxplus to a jetphys installation; run "root -l -b -q ../combine.C\(\"X\"\)". This will create a collection of pileup_DTu.root (and pileup_DT.root).
 - Here, X refers to the era picked from settins.h (e.g. X=Fe) - check that the era index printed on command line is OK.
 - The unnormalized histograms (pileup_DTu.root) may be safely added with hadd for combinations, e.g. BCD.
 - This requires the correct weight values and run year settings to be present in settings.h.
Step 8: Run "root -l -b -q ../normalize.C" for the combinations. This will result in appropriately weighted histos (pileup_DT.root).
